Go to codeforces -> Problem set

Sort problems by dificulty and start by the easiest ones. Be careful, there are dificult problems that have no score yet, so change pages until you find the tests that are graded with the lowest dificulty scores.

Alternate between doing easy codeforces tests and reading the Competitive Programming book that is free online

5 Tips to become a red coder in codeforces
- Practice a lot
- If you are learning a topic, choose problems that have editorials, read the first sentences of the editorial and try again, if you still can't read the whole thing
- Don't choose problems that are too easy or too hard, choose ones that are slightly above your comfort zone
- Dont' spend more than 20 or 30 minutes stuck on a problem
- If after solving a problem of a certain type and you find another one of the same type and you can't solve it, it means you didn't learn the technique, focus more on it

## Step 1

- Learn english (ok)
- Learn math
    - Forget: ~~Geometry, Trigonometry and Calculus~~
    - Algebra
    - Combinatorics
    - Modular Arithmetic
    - Number Theory
    - Graph (Can be learn along the way)
    - You can practice going to hackerrank and check the "Mathmatics" problem section and select the types of exercise by the topics above
- Touch typing - 60 wpm min (ok)

## Step 2

Learn programming language. C++ is recommended but you can get to grandmaster on codeforces (score 2400) using java. Transition after that

When you decide to transition, use the first 5 hours of:

After that you can go c++ section on hackerrank

## Step 3

Learn basic problem solving, algorithms and data structures
- Competitive handbook again

https://jadi.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/competetive-programmers-handbook.pdf

- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fundamentals-of-algorithms/
- Google specific conceptual topic (like Dynamic Programming)
- Algorith section on hackerrank
    - HR has a "editorial" section on problems that you can consult to have more context to solve it and learn
- He doesn't recommend roadmaps but there are some
    - https://a2oj.com/ladders
    - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iJZWP2nS_OB3kCTjq8L6TrJJ4o-5lhxDOyTaocSYc-k/edit#gid=84654839
- There are some contests that are good for beginner
    - First exercises of leetcode weekly/biweekly
    - AtCoder Beginner
    - Codeforces Div3

## Step 4

Improve through constant practice

## General Tips
- MIT Open courseware has good classes on algorithms and data structures
- Don't read too much (Try to improve by practice). For each 100 minutes of CP, 5 minutes should be reading stuff
- Be careful no to end up trying to learn too advanced techniques, most programming interviews require simpler solutions because they are more reliable and take less time to implement
- Don't compare yourself to others
- He has a discord channel https://discord.gg/AneA5wg
